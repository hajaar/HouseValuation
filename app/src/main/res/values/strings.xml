    <string name="eula">Hello. Thank you for using my app. This is supposed to be an EULA. So here goes... \n I have created this app based on my knowledge of the current indian tax laws. While this knowledge is good, I am not an expert. I have tried to be as accurate as possible but there are rounding off errors, bugs and a not too comprehensive implementation of tax laws. So please use this app as a guidance and do not stake your life savings on it - I will not be responsible for any loss in any form. :-D</string>
